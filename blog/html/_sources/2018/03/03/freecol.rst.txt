Freecol_!

I used to love Sid Meier's Colonization as a child. I used to play it on
our Amiga 1200. I had a hankering for playing it and I found FreeCol, an
open source version. Better than paying Â£4.99 for an ancient game from Steam!

I'll download it and have a play.

Maybe I'll get involved in writing it. I've always had an ambition to write
a game (which I achieved, in a manner of speaking, by writing Chessrisk_).
What one person can achieve alone in their spare time is limited, though,
so contributing to a multi-person effort would potentially be more rewarding.

It would be a good way to learn Java, and feel I'm contributing to something.
