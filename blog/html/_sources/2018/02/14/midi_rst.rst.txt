Stupid App Idea: Turn recorded music into midi
=================================================

Take a recording of some real music, and produce a midi version of the
notes played by the real, alive musicians. This would enable us to
answer questions such as: what would it sound like if Jimi Hendrix
played synth harpsichord?

This would be achieved by the magic of Fourier transforms. Machine
learning could also be involved, because hey, that's the answer to
everything.
