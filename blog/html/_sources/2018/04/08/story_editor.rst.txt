Creative Writing Text Editor
============================

I don't think there are any text editors aimed at creative writing.

If I were doing creative writing, I would have some specific needs.

- Minimal fuss with formatting. I want headings, italics, bold. I probably
  don't need much else beyond Unicode.
- Version control. I would want to develop a story, expanding parts, moving
  parts, deleting parts, etc. I would want to do this easily without
  fear of losing the version I already had. And be able to view old versions.
- Storage of elements other than the main text. Plot outline. Character info.
  A bibliography (for my use or for publishing). General notes.
- WYSIWYG presentation. Even speaking as a programmer. I enter a slightly
  different mental context if I'm reading something that looks like printed
  text, and this is the context in which I usually consume creative writing.

Essentially, this describes any editor that allows you to write in a markup
language OR in a WYSIWYG editor that 'compiles' into a markup language. The
one extra feature beyond this is the support for 'metadata' such as plot
outline. A writer can store these in free-form text, but it would be nice
to have editor awareness of these things, so you can tag names in the story
with links to the crib sheet of a character, or link points in the story
to the plot outline, etc.
