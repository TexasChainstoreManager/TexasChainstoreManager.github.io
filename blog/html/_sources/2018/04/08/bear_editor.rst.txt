Bear Editor
===========

Further to the below post about creative writing text editors,
the `Bear Editor`_ is a good WYSIWYG editor that supports Markdown.

One can export to Markdown, which would allow version control of
the exported file. If you write Markdown in the editor, the formatting
is understood. So you can copy-paste your markdown back in (or just
import from Markdown using the built-in support).
