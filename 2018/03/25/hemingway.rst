Hemingway and Emender
=====================

There is a text editor called Hemingway_ that makes your writing more
direct and concise. Hemingway was known as a very spare writer, hence
the name. The editor highlights certain elements of writing that can
make it unclear.

A related concept is Emender_. It provides some sort of test framework
for docs. It's a bit more flexible than Hemingway in that it can be run
as part of a build process and its rules are scriptable.
(I haven't really looked into it though.)
